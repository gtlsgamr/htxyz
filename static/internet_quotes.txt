Some internet quotes/posts that I find interesting:

make shitty decisions over and over, refusing all help, until they destroy
themselves. ~ RandumUser31

=-> One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that, lacking zero, they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C Programs. ~ Robert Firth

Some internet quotes/posts that I find interesting:

=-> God, what has Mozilla done to itself. Like watching that friend continually
make shitty decisions over and over, refusing all help, until they destroy
themselves. ~ RandumUser31

=-> One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that, lacking zero, they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C Programs. ~ Robert Firth

 
=->	Evi rite gulaal maange che,
	Koi jaane vhaal maange che.
	Pote saaf suthra rahi ne,
	Rangva Maro gaal mange che.
		~ SNR

=->	Dig jeevan jo sehta hi aaya hai virodh,
	Dig saadhan jiske liye sada hi kiya shodh,
	Jaanki haay uddhar priya ka ho na saka,
	Par ek aur mann raha Ram ka jo na thaka.
		~ Nirala

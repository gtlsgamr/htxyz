  <p>Shri Hanuman is the epitome of selfless service, courage, hope and strength. He is, and should be an inspiration to us all in more that one ways. Even for those who don&rsquo;t believe in him, his story is one with valuable life lessons.</p>
<p>Unfathomable innocence has always been a defining character of Shri Hanuman, according to me. Since he was a child, his childish innocent actions never let the devotee/reader think that they&rsquo;re reading/thinking about a literal god. The very incarnation of Lord Shiva. Take for example, the incident when he tried to eat the sun, thinking it was a golden fruit. Children might think that, but gods actually try to eat it.</p>
<p>Throughout the incidents narrated in Hindu scriptures, not once is Hanumanji seen to have any negative emotions. They have always been positive, bringing the devotee/reader back into a pleasant state of mind.</p>
<p>Talking about courage and fearlessness, almost every Indian household has seen Hanuman Chalisa being recited whenever the user is in a state of panic, stress, depression, or literally being chased by ghosts. Shri Hanuman&rsquo;s name itself is enough to strike fear into the hearts of one&rsquo;s enemies and bring peace to one&rsquo;s mind. It&rsquo;s an old saying in Indian villages, &ldquo;No one can harm the devotee of a devotee.&rdquo;, thus, being a devotee of Shri Hanuman is a great way to live life. Free from fear, free from attachments, and always with courage in mind, strengh in arms, and Shri Ram in your heart.</p>
<p>This brings me to a bhajan of Bajrangbali, that has made it&rsquo;s place in my heart since not so long ago. I am putting it here in devnagari and roman script, with translations. It is about Shri Ram, after defeating Raavan and coming back to ayodhya, is telling his brother Bharat about how he will never be able to repay the debt of Hanuman. (Another tale about Shri Ram and the debts he paid will come here soon.)</p>
<h2 id="bharat-bhai">Bharat Bhai</h2>
<pre><code>भरतभाई! कपि से उरिन हम नाही ||
Bharat bhai, kapi se urin hum naahi
</code></pre><p><strong>Bharat, my brother, we will never be able to repay the debt of kapi (monkey, shree hanuman)</strong></p>
<pre><code>एठो खाय अछूत खवावत | हाथ धोवत टक माहि || १ ||
etho khhay, achhoot khavaavat. Haath dhovat, tak maahi
</code></pre><p><strong>He is so innocent and child-like, that he doesn&rsquo;t wash hands after eating at the designated place, but in his plate(tak) itself</strong></p>
<pre><code>सौ योजन मर्याद सिंधू की | लांग गयो पल माहि |
Sau yojan maryaad sindhu ki, laangh gayo pal maahi
</code></pre><p><strong>The length of the sea was 1200 kilimetres, and yet he jumped it over in a moment</strong></p>
<pre><code>लंका जाय सिया सोधी लाये | गर्ब नाहि मन माहि || २ ||
Lanka jaay, siya sodhi laaye, garb nahi man maahi
</code></pre><p><strong>He went to the lanka, and found Siya mata, and yet he didn&rsquo;t get pride in his mind</strong></p>
<pre><code>शती बाण लग्यो लछमन के | शोर भयो दल माहि |
shati baan lagyo, lachman (laxman) ko, shor bhayo dal maahi
</code></pre><p><strong>Laxman got shot by a hundred arrows, and the whole army was in chaos with shouts and cries</strong></p>
<pre><code>द्रोणागिरी पर्वत ले आयो | भोर होने नहि पायी || ३ ||
DronaGiri Parbat le aayo, bhor hone nahi paayi
</code></pre><p><strong>But Hanuman carried a whole mountain(Dronagiri) where the medicine grew, to save laxman before the sun could rise</strong></p>
<pre><code>अहि रावण की भुजा उखाडी | बैठ रह्यो मठ माहि |
Ahiraavan ki bhuja ukhaadi, baith rahyo math maahi
</code></pre><p><strong>When the demon ahiraavan secretly carried away Shri Ram and Laxman to nether world, Hanumanji tore off his limbs and brought them back. Even after saving their lives, he sat quietly in the math(the place where they stayed). Hanumanji does not have any pride.</strong></p>
<pre><code>या पर भरत जो हनुमत ना होते | को ल्यावत जग माहि || ४ ||
Yaa par bharat jo hanumat naa hote, ko lyaavat jag maahi
</code></pre><p><strong>Oh bharat, if hanuman wasn&rsquo;t there. Who would&rsquo;ve brought us back from the underworld?</strong></p>
<pre><code>तुलसीदास मारुतसुत महिमा | प्रभु अपने मुख से गायी |
Tulsidas maarutsut mahima, prabhu apne mukh se gaayi
</code></pre><p><strong>The glory of lord hanuman is sung by Shri Ram himself</strong>
भरतभाई! कपि से उरिन हम नाही || ५ ||</p>

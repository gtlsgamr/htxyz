<p>I wrote for you.   <br/>
Wasted a thousand words,   <br/>
Filled up a million notes for you.</p>

<p>I showed you my work,   <br/>
I bared what was left of me   <br/>
Broke my mind penning it down,   <br/>
Just to feel that hit of ecstacy.</p>

<p>I poured my heart out.   <br/>
Clich√©? I know.   <br/>
Rephrase.   <br/>
I put my soul out and let it wander   <br/>
The white sea of my pages.   <br/>
I let it write free of judgement   <br/>
Beautiful, broken, repugnant.   <br/>
And once it was done   <br/>
I put it back in.   <br/>
Eternally caged,   <br/>
until my heart broke again.</p>

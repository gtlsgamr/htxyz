<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful out here at night.   <br/>
You should come see it sometime.</p>

<p>The roads are empty,   <br/>
Streetlights burn bright   <br/>
The cold seeps through your heart   <br/>
And yet the fire inside fights.</p>

<p>Problems are a matter of tomorrow.   <br/>
This is your time to live   <br/>
Forget your sorrows   <br/>
At least until this time you borrowed   <br/>
Runs out,   <br/>
and before you know it,   <br/>
It&rsquo;s over. Guns out   <br/>
Time to fight that war again,   <br/>
Time to be reborn again.   <br/>
Time to get up and be thrown again   <br/>
at life,   <br/>
The seeds of solitude are sown again.   <br/>
Sun rises, you die inside   <br/>
Until night falls again.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful out here at night.   <br/>
You should come see it sometime.</p>

<p>of stormy skies, spread far and wide?   <br/>
Do they cower in fear   <br/>
of what lies within?    <br/>
Or hope that its all a fever dream,    <br/>
and hide their heads in their motherâ€™s laps,    <br/>
peeking between their fingergaps.</p>

<p>Do cavemen dream of cheery weather?    <br/>
And Singing birds with flashy feathers?    <br/>
Clear skies, fluffy clouds    <br/>
where they could shout their truth aloud.    <br/>
Or do they live just like us?    <br/>
In fear of what we must become,    <br/>
to live out till seventy one    <br/>
and lose the will to have some fun.</p>

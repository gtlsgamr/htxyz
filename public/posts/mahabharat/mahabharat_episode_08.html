<h1>Recap</h1>

<p>We left the court of Hastinapur under the able leadership of Pandu when we last
met. He married Kunti, and his blind brother Dhritrashtra was married to
Gandhari. We also got to see the birth of Karna, the gifted son from Surya Dev to Kunti, who she had to abandon in the river.</p>

<h1>Madri</h1>

<blockquote><p>Aap Chandravanshi hai aryaputra, katore me padi chandrama ki chhaya ko chandrama samaj lena aapko shobha nahi deta.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>After winning over half the nation, Pandu encounters the king of <em>Madra</em> who
instead of going to battle, befriends Pandu and gifts his sister <em>Madri</em>&rsquo;s hand in marriage to him. He also gives his army and kingdom to Pandu.</p>

<p><em>Madri</em> is gladly accepted by the other women of the court, and welcomed as a
sister by <em>Pandu&rsquo;s</em> wife Kunti. The people of the court want the king to rest
for a while, since he has been at war since a long time. He accepts, after
winning another war without lifting his sword. Before leaving he gives the
royal crown to Dhritrashtra.</p>

<p>Pandu goes in special gardens made for him to rest with his queens where he
meets sage Kindama. Shakuni tries to exploit Dhritrashtra&rsquo;s love for the royal throne.
Pandu seems drawn to the life of an ascetic.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Somehow the titles of these episodes are always misleading and miss the point.
The official title of this episode is <strong><em>The gift of Madri, and sage Kindama&rsquo;s
curse</em></strong>. The part about Madri is just a small story in major events that seem
to be happening. The desperation in Dhritrashtra&rsquo;s blind eyes can be easily
seen when he dons the royal crown for the first time. His hesitance to take off
the crown even in private quarters with Gandhari shows how much yearns for the
one thing that he gave up. He will blame his incompetence on anyone he can,
except his own birth. It was in his fate, and he is not ready to accept it.</p>

<p>Pandu, despite being the one with poor health seems to be a good king. He is
loved by the people, has two loving wives, and is a capable warrior. He has
extended the boundaries of Hastinapur to lengths never seen before. He is the
ideal king. And yet, he seems to have tendancies like king Ashoka in him. He
seems to be drawn to the spiritual side, and we see it when he talks with sage
Kindama. This does not bode well for the future of Hastinapur. A capable king
wanting to be an ascetic, and an uncapable one wanting to be king? That&rsquo;s a recipe
for disaster.</p>

<p>Some references might be minor spoilers for first time viewers. Kunti says that
she doesn&rsquo;t want to play dice anymore. Dice make her anxious for her future,
almost telling her that it will bring ruin in its wake.</p>

<p>There are three debts that a <em>satpurush</em>, an ideal man has to pay. The debt to
god, the debt to teacher, and the debt to ancestors. The debt to god is paid by
charity, it can be any form of charity. Not just material posessions but mental
as well. Surrendering yourself in service of humanity is also charity. The debt
to the teacher is paid by passing on the knowledge that you gain. <em>Gyaan baatne
se badhta hai.</em> And the debt to ancestors is paid by having children. These
three debts have to be paid by a <em>satpurush</em> in his lifetime. Pandu already
seems to have paid back the first two debts, now lets see what he does in the
future.</p>

<p>When Shakuni is trying to get Dhritrashtra to try for the royal throne, the
turmoil in Dhritrashtra&rsquo;s head is evident. He tries to tell Shakuni to stop
trying to make the two brothers fight, and yet the crown feels heavenly on his
blind head. The future of Hastinapur looks bleak for now. As I have said
before, Mahabharat is a story of tragedy. It is not going to end well for any
of the characters. Our purpose is to learn lessons from the mistakes of these
people and learn to live better lives. Until next time!</p>

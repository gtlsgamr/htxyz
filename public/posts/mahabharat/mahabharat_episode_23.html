<h4>Recap</h4>

<p>The princes train under drona while Bhishma worries about the kingdom&rsquo;s future.</p>

<h4>Guru Dakshina</h4>

<blockquote><p>Irshya manushya ke guno ko dimak ke bhaati khaa jati hai.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>Eklavya is introduced as an archer equal to Arjun in terms of skill, but is promptly disabled by Drona by asking for his right thumb as Guru Dakshina. Karna trains under Parshuram after being denied by Drona. Shri Krishna finishes his education under Guru Sandipani and starts a new era by blowing his titular conch, <em>panchjanya</em>. Everyone prepares for the return of royal princes.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>After a slew of filler episodes with same theme of &ldquo;Pandav good, Kaurav bad&rdquo;,
we can finally see the plot moving forward. Albeit slower than an overloaded
truck on a single lane road. We are getting away from blacks and whites and
moving more into grey territory. Eklavya, an archer equal to Arjun is denied a
chance at a life as an archer just because Drona wanted Arjun to succeed. Again
I would like to mention the spread of misinformation that Drona took away
Eklavya&rsquo;s thumb because he was not a Kshatriya. Drona did it only for political
reason and his affection for Arjun. Nothing else. While this was happening,
Karna is learning under the watchful eye of Parshuram, the same Parshuram who
we shall meet again when I review Ramayan. He is a legend in Hindu epics, and
for good reason.</p>

<p>Speaking of legends, we will now be able to witness one of the most legendary
performances in Indian TV history by Nitish Bhardwaj. The iconic role of Shri
Krishna played beautifully by NB will never be matched by contemporaries. Every
word uttered, every act performed is a testament to the fact that he was made
for this part. Moving on, we saw two apt metaphors in the scene with
Dhritrashtra and Shakuni. When Shakuni meets Dhritrashtra in the chamber of his
room, Dhritrashtra is alone in the darkness. A blind man meets a snake in a
dark room. What could go wrong? Dhritrashtra tells Shakuni that he didn&rsquo;t hear
him come in, to which Shakuni replies that he should learn to do that since he
can&rsquo;t listen to the sound of the royal throne being pulled away from Duryodhan.
In reality, Dhritrashtra can&rsquo;t hear the sound of his eventual downfall as
Shakuni keeps playing him for ulterior motives. Dhritrashtra chooses to remain
in the dark because he knows that he is not strong enough to bear the truth. His
love for his son is stronger than his morality.</p>

<p>Another big topic in this episode was Guru Dakshina. We witness three
Dakshinas, two to Dronacharya and one to Guru Sandipani. First is obviously by
Eklavya, which Dronacharya took to ensure Arjun&rsquo;s supremacy as the best archer
in the world. Second was offered by Dhritrashtra to Drona for educating the
princes, in the form a palaces and gold and all sorts of riches. This second
Dakshina was denied by Drona, as he educated them on the fact that a Guru
doesn&rsquo;t receive a Dakshina but rather asks for it. He will ask for it in due
time. (<em>hmm, I wonder if this is foreshadowing&hellip;</em>) The third was given by
Krishna to Sandipani in the form of his son who was kidnapped as a child by
demons and rescued by Krishna and Balram. From there Shri Krishna found
Panchjanya, his conch which he blows to signal the beginning of a new era. All
Dakshina&rsquo;s are given with different motives. All three are taken with different
feelings. But in the end, all three are Dakshinas, and a shiksha is not over
until the student gives his Dakshina.</p>

<p>In the end, the princes are due to return, and I suspect they will be all grown up
in the next episode. Everyone is ready to see them display their skill and prowess
in the ceremony that is being held. All the
Thus ends this episode which seems to have ended streak of filler episodes in
this epic series.</p>

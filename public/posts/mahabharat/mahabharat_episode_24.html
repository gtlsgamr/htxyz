<h4>Rangbhoomi</h4>

<blockquote><p>Aaj se mera jeevan tumhare liye, Meri Nishtha tumhari, aur meri mrityu bhi tumhari hi hogi.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>The princes return to Hastinapur and take part in a competition
designed to show off their skills. They all introduce themselves in front of
king Dhritrashtra, while Kunti narrates the happenings to a bling Gandhari.
Yudishthir fights all the princes at once and defeats them subsequently. Bheem
and Duryodhan fight with <em>gadas</em>, and have to be seperated when the fight turns
serious. Arjun steals the show with his magical arrow skills, summoning the
four elements from the sky using the arrows. Karna comes to challenge Arjun,
but is denied a fair fight by the elders using various excuses. At one point
Duryodhan makes Karna the king of <em>ang</em> kingdom, but Karna is still denied a
shot at the competition.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>Not too much to discuss in this episode but here are some
points that I think are worth marking:</p>

<ul>
<li>The blind Gandhari can easily recognise the sound of Bhishma&rsquo;s conch.</li>
<li>After the fight ends between Bhim and Duryodhan, Dhritrashtra eagerly asks
Vidur about who was stronger. The blind king still tries to find ways to make
sure Duryodhan gets the throne. Vidur being Vidur, gave a diplomatic reply,
much to the anger of Dhritrashtra.</li>
<li>I think Arjun&rsquo;s powers are shown as a bit too strong. I don&rsquo;t remember
reading anywhere that teleportation was one of the powers of his arrows, but
I think some flair was needed to make this a popular show back in the day.</li>
<li>Of course Karna&rsquo;s garland would go on Dhritrashtra&rsquo;s neck. An enemy of my
enemy is my friend.</li>
<li>Speaking of friends, in this episode we witness the beginning of a lifelong
friendship. Duryodhan and Karna&rsquo;s friendship is pretty famous for being
unquestioningly loyal.</li>
<li>Kunti realised who Karna was the moment she saw him and fainted.</li>
<li>Karna being denied a fair chance at the competition was a bit sad but I think
it was done for the greater good, since a non kshatriya winning that
competition would bring about some massive civil revolts that would be hard
to control. Not letting him compete due to his caste or birth is just a
facade to hide the fact that him winning would bring about a storm of chaos
in Hastinapur, which already very volatile.</li>
</ul>

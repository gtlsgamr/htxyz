      <description>Of cloudy skies and petrichor, Thirty days an eternity. &amp;lsquo;twas the best month of them all. Of cloudy skies and petrichor, and bruised ribs and broken bones The sun was all that we could see. Of cloudy skies and petrichor, Thirty days an eternity.</description>

      <description>I see light-headed hipsters high on Sensationalized trends Performing ecstatical stunts Fueled by purposeless strength. Halt the boat, for the time is now To burn the place down Look around, You&amp;rsquo;ll see pretentious pussies Pasting pointless posts on Pedantic positivity and preposterous presumptions For perverted pathetic, Pussies. Consumed by the love for Quirks and bizzare things Things that are never real, never been. Eyes like sacks of sand hanging heavy On faces who&amp;rsquo;ve seen some shit.</description>

      <description>We sit here Alone, broken Bashed into, forsaken. An eternity we have longed For the steam of kettle To turn into a song And the noisy waterfall of a fiery hot drink To Fill our leaking bases Before we go extinct. Instead, harsh rain fills us Every few months or so And we let it molest us We have nowhere to go But we will have our day We ignore what the commode And the broken cars say After all they&amp;rsquo;re trash Their purpose long fulfilled And we&amp;rsquo;re broken teacups in a junkyard Waiting to be filled.</description>

      <description>ul.dl, the no-bullshit file hosting service You might have heard of 0x0, the no-bullshit file hosting service. It is a service for quickly sharing files right from your command line without having to point or click anywhere. What you do is, you send a POST request to the site with the file and the site will respond with a url that has the raw content of that file.
For example,</description>

      <description>How I made my own commenting engine Well, before you go on, you might be wondering, what is a commenting engine? A commenting engine is a piece of code that handles comments on a website or app and the likes. On this website, before this point, there was no option for comments. After that I tried messing with some commenting engines such as Disqus and Staticman and many more. My core issue with most of these was that either they were hosted by third party, or they needed some sort of hosting by the site owner.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Hanumanji</title>

      <description>Shri Hanuman is the epitome of selfless service, courage, hope and strength. He is, and should be an inspiration to us all in more that one ways. Even for those who don&amp;rsquo;t believe in him, his story is one with valuable life lessons.
Unfathomable innocence has always been a defining character of Shri Hanuman, according to me. Since he was a child, his childish innocent actions never let the devotee/reader think that they&amp;rsquo;re reading/thinking about a literal god.</description>

      <description>When a tree dies
The wayward souls lose their shade.
Their shade is no more, Neither is the cold whistling of the wind which moves the leaves- A lullaby to listening ears
Listening ears still long for it the rustling leaves and chirping birds. The support to lay their back on- All gone when a tree dies.
When a tree dies
His son takes up the role. He&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to cry, or mourn, or show weakness.</description>

      <description>like alcohol in the stone pits hailed, wanted, but lonely. In limbo, unhinged from reality thinking about the skies, while baffled by morality.
I scoured the universe, in search of salvation while my god&amp;rsquo;s abode was in my soul&amp;rsquo;s foundation.
like mangoes in cardboard boxes sweet, free from paradoxes In heaven, hinged to reality thinking about the world unbothered by mortality.</description>

      <description>उदासी तुझमें है, तनहाई मेरे भी अंदर है, लोग वही है, समय बस अलग है। काल चक्र का कोई जादू सा मंतर है। कैसे बताऊं मै? कोई अदृश्य अक्षर है। बातें वही है, बस शब्दों में कुछ अंतर है।</description>

      <title>[FIX] ELan touchpad stops working at boot</title>

      <description>There was this issue that I faced in my system (HP Pavilion Gaming 15 Laptop) in which the touchpad (ElanTech) would stop working when the laptop booted, the fix to which was to move my finger on the touchpad when the system was booting up. Doing this every time was not convenient, so it took me a while, but this is what I did.
Create a script, called touchpadrestart.sh and put the below code in it.</description>

      <description>Universes die. Then what am I? A measly human, a small fry.
Life gives and life takes. And the rest of it, death rakes. Civilizations are devoured, Myths forgotten, Languages are lost In the jaws of time.
No one remembers Past two generations Great grandfathers: not so great anymore.
Universes die. Then what am I? A measly human, a small fry.</description>

      <title>Religion and its reasons</title>

      <description>I was an atheist in the past. It was less because of my personal beliefs and more because all the cool kids did it, but other than that, my religion was liberal in that matter. It allowed us to do as we wish, to follow who we want.
Not knowing what it was to have someone to look to for support, someone who you have never met irl and yet they are the strongest power you know, is something that I only realized after I got out of the atheist phase.</description>

<h1>How I made my own commenting engine</h1>

<p>Well, before you go on, you might be wondering, what is a commenting engine? A commenting engine is a piece of code that handles comments on a website or app and the likes. On this website, before this point, there was no option for comments. After that I tried messing with some commenting engines such as <a href="https://blog.disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and <a href="https://staticman.net">Staticman</a> and many more. My core issue with most of these was that either they were hosted by third party, or they needed some sort of hosting by the site owner. I was looking for a free solution (free as in both free speech and free food), that could handle comments. Then I found <a href="https://utteranc.es/">utterances!</a> It was everything I needed. It wasn&rsquo;t hosted by some shady third party, it was free and didn&rsquo;t require me to host anything. Yet, there was one <strong><em>issue</em></strong>. Yes, I made that pun. <em>utterances</em> used GitHub issues to act as storage for comments. It was a very intuitive interface, but its reliance on GitHub bugged me. Hence, I set out to make my own commenting engine that was <strong><em>A FREE/Libre commenting engine that is lightweight, serverless, and possibly <del>doesn&rsquo;t</del> requires wonky workarounds.</em></strong></p>

<h2>in the beginning</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know anything about how commenting engines worked, but I had a goal in mind, to have a commenting engine that supported the given definition. I made a repo and started working. Soon I realised that the engine has to be dependent on javascript since that was the only way to have it serverless. Initially the definition contained the phrase</p>

<blockquote><p>doesn&rsquo;t require wonky workarounds</p></blockquote>

<p>which had to be removed, because no way in hell was I going to make something that fit that definition without workarounds. Thus was born, <a href="https://github.com/gtlsgamr/comments">comments</a>.</p>

<h2>how it works</h2>

<p><strong><em>comments</em></strong> basically works as a middleman to help the commenter compose the comment and the site owner to have a nicely formatted json to add to the site.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Commenter enters the comment on a post.</li>
<li><strong><em>comments</em></strong> takes the time, date, the post on which the comment was made, nickname for the commenter and creates a json object and passes it in a <code>mailto</code> link which will open the mail client of the commenter.</li>
<li>It will have a preformatted email that the commenter just has to send.</li>
<li>The site owner receives the mail and looks at the comment. They will then copy the json and paste it inside the <em>comments-data.json</em> file in their static site directory.</li>
<li>Every time a page on the site loads, comments will parse that json file and display the comments accordingly!</li>
</ol>


<h2>how you can help!</h2>

<p>It works fine by itself for now but I want to make it a bit more feature rich. Here are some things that might make this project a <em>little</em> bit better.</p>

<ol>
<li>A github pages or some kind of landing page.</li>
<li>Nested comments and a show more button to hide comments if there are more than x amount of comments.</li>
<li>✨ CSS Styles! ✨ Currently the default style is very basic looking (the way i prefer) but the project will be much more feature-rich if the users could have different theming options for their comments.</li>
</ol>


<p>Honestly, it was a lot of fun making this. I hope people use it to display comments on their websites and help improve this project!</p>

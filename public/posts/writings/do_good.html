<p>I am writing this at 11:14 PM on 31st December 2021. But it doesn&rsquo;t really
matter what date or what time is it as long as it is a new beginning for
anyone. It is just a new page in the calendar. So this is <em>an ode to 202x,
doesn&rsquo;t matter which</em>.</p>

<p>I started this site about a year ago, and I have not written much stuff in
here, other than the Mahabharat reviews and some projects I made. So I guess,
this post will be a start of an influx of &lsquo;posts&rsquo;, if that makes sense. If I
had a word to describe 202x, it would be, <strong>fast</strong>. The days went by like
raindrops on a glass window, ever moving, ever changing. It is all a blur at
this point, truly. I wonder if it is because of the stagnancy that we all had
collectively become a part of. It has been a bad year for businesses,
especially those that are at a considerable distance from computers. People who
don&rsquo;t get paychecks and have to actually get out of a chair to earn their share
of money.</p>

<p>It seems like every month in a 202x year brought some new depressing thing with
it&ndash; and every next month the world fought and came back stronger. We all did,
and we did that by <em>doing good</em>. For every saddening experience I had, there
was a ray of hope somewhere. All I saw was people doing good for others,
selfless sacrifices. And maybe I choose to ignore the worst in the world, but
is it not for my own good? The further I stay away from the rot, the happier I
will be. At this point I am just rambling and it is 11:30 already, but this
post is an end and a beginning.</p>

<p>I want to do good. In each and every way possible. To those who need it the
most, and are afraid to ask for it. I will try to <em>be good</em>. That is all, I
guess. I hope this year breaks the streak of the pandemic and we get to return
to normal soon. Or maybe not, I don&rsquo;t know. Staying and home is also heaven in
itself. Until then, stay safe, see you again.</p>

What you do is, you send a POST request to the site with the file and the site will respond with a url that has the raw content of that file.

      <description>How I made my own commenting engine Well, before you go on, you might be wondering, what is a commenting engine? A commenting engine is a piece of code that handles comments on a website or app and the likes. On this website, before this point, there was no option for comments. After that I tried messing with some commenting engines such as Disqus and Staticman and many more. My core issue with most of these was that either they were hosted by third party, or they needed some sort of hosting by the site owner.</description>

      <description>There was this issue that I faced in my system (HP Pavilion Gaming 15 Laptop) in which the touchpad (ElanTech) would stop working when the laptop booted, the fix to which was to move my finger on the touchpad when the system was booting up. Doing this every time was not convenient, so it took me a while, but this is what I did.
Create a script, called touchpadrestart.sh and put the below code in it.</description>

      <description>Of cloudy skies and petrichor, Thirty days an eternity. &amp;lsquo;twas the best month of them all. Of cloudy skies and petrichor, and bruised ribs and broken bones The sun was all that we could see. Of cloudy skies and petrichor, Thirty days an eternity.</description>

      <description>I see light-headed hipsters high on Sensationalized trends Performing ecstatical stunts Fueled by purposeless strength. Halt the boat, for the time is now To burn the place down Look around, You&amp;rsquo;ll see pretentious pussies Pasting pointless posts on Pedantic positivity and preposterous presumptions For perverted pathetic, Pussies. Consumed by the love for Quirks and bizzare things Things that are never real, never been. Eyes like sacks of sand hanging heavy On faces who&amp;rsquo;ve seen some shit.</description>

      <description>We sit here Alone, broken Bashed into, forsaken. An eternity we have longed For the steam of kettle To turn into a song And the noisy waterfall of a fiery hot drink To Fill our leaking bases Before we go extinct. Instead, harsh rain fills us Every few months or so And we let it molest us We have nowhere to go But we will have our day We ignore what the commode And the broken cars say After all they&amp;rsquo;re trash Their purpose long fulfilled And we&amp;rsquo;re broken teacups in a junkyard Waiting to be filled.</description>

      <description>When a tree dies
The wayward souls lose their shade.
Their shade is no more, Neither is the cold whistling of the wind which moves the leaves- A lullaby to listening ears
Listening ears still long for it the rustling leaves and chirping birds. The support to lay their back on- All gone when a tree dies.
When a tree dies
His son takes up the role. He&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to cry, or mourn, or show weakness.</description>

      <description>like alcohol in the stone pits hailed, wanted, but lonely. In limbo, unhinged from reality thinking about the skies, while baffled by morality.
I scoured the universe, in search of salvation while my god&amp;rsquo;s abode was in my soul&amp;rsquo;s foundation.
like mangoes in cardboard boxes sweet, free from paradoxes In heaven, hinged to reality thinking about the world unbothered by mortality.</description>

      <description>उदासी तुझमें है, तनहाई मेरे भी अंदर है, लोग वही है, समय बस अलग है। काल चक्र का कोई जादू सा मंतर है। कैसे बताऊं मै? कोई अदृश्य अक्षर है। बातें वही है, बस शब्दों में कुछ अंतर है।</description>

      <description>Universes die. Then what am I? A measly human, a small fry.
Life gives and life takes. And the rest of it, death rakes. Civilizations are devoured, Myths forgotten, Languages are lost In the jaws of time.
No one remembers Past two generations Great grandfathers: not so great anymore.
Universes die. Then what am I? A measly human, a small fry.</description>

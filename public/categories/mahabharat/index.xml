      <description>Recap The story of Krishna ends and the focus comes back to Hastinapur. Pandu dies and Madri with him, while Kunti takes his five sons to Hastinapur.
An uncertain future  Mai shok mana raha hoon unn jeevan moolyo ka jinki mrityu meri aankhon ke saamne ho rahi hai. Main shok mana raha hoon uss ujli rekha ka jo hamare purvajo ne satya aur asatya ke beech kheechi thi maa. Mai ro raha hoon uss kathor sachchai par, ki maine pitashri ko jis singhasan ki raksha karne ka vachan diya tha, jis singhasan ko nishtha ki shapath di thi.</description>

      <description>Recap An infant krishna, who is growing up in Gokul brings death to the demoness Putana send by Kansa.
Krishna Leela  Vo to iss jagat ka hai, use iss jagat me hi bat jaane do..
 I have decided to bunch these five episodes in one post because subjectively they don&amp;rsquo;t have anything that can have long discussions. It is nothing but various leelas of shri krishna. I have added multiple shots from the episodes to let the reader familiarize themselves with the theme and tone of these episodes.</description>

      <description>Recap We left the court of Hastinapur under the able leadership of Pandu when we last met. He married Kunti, and his blind brother Dhritrashtra was married to Gandhari.

      <description>NOTE: I have added a commenting functionality to the site, it is for mail-in comments so it may or may not be up your lane. Try it if you feel like!
After feedback from the exactly three people that read this website, I have discovered that the series seems like a story retelling and not a discussion. So after this one, all the episdode discussions that are posted on this site will have three sections, viz.</description>

      <description>Recap Now that the reign of Shantanu is over, we move on to bigger things. Things that will set in motion one of the biggest wars to take place in India. Bhishma, now the protector of the princes Chitrangad and Vichitravir as well as the kingdom, now holds the court by proxy.
Amba, Ambika, Ambalika  Ghatnaao aur durghatnaao ke paas koi ichchhashakti nahi hoti
 I feel like some long unnecessary parts of the story are skipped, and rightly so.</description>

      <description>Recap After a two weeks of inactivity, here I am again. Two weeks ago we saw how Devvrat was ready to give up worldly pleasures just so his father can stay happy and in turn, the kingdom of Hastinapur can prosper. His vow of celibacy was called Bhishma or terrible. Moving on let&amp;rsquo;s see how Shantanu tries to justify his son taking up celibacy for his father.
Ichchha Mrityu  &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;shanti aur ashanti ke daurahe par khada ye Shantanu tumhe ye vardaan deta hai.</description>

      <description>Recap Back to the story after a very uneventful episode, this is a turning point in the story of Devvrat and Shantanu, and on a larger scale the kingdom of Hastinapur. We saw Ganga tell Shantanu why she did what she did (infanticide), which was merciful in a way. Shantanu waits for about 16 years for his son to get his training and come back, prepped to be heir in the democratic kingdom of Hastinapur.</description>

      <description>Recap In the previous episode, we had a brief look at the life of King Shantanu, and his river/wife/queen Ganga. We saw her kill their newborn babies one after another, while Shantanu watched helplessly. While the reason is unknown, we can imagine that the heartless killings must have some substance to them. Why else would a mother kill seven of her newborns? In this episode we will see Shantanu choose between his love for his wife and his love for his children that don&amp;rsquo;t get to see a day of life.</description>

      <description>Recap Last we saw king Bharat establish a new trend of choosing the ruler by merit and not by right of birth. Many years have passed since then and now we look at another king of Hastinapur, Shantanu.
The wedding of Shantanu  To ek vachan dijiye.
  Aaj se mere saare vachan tumhare
 Shantanu, who is out to hunt deer (because that&amp;rsquo;s what kings do in their free time) spots a beautiful lady come out of a river.</description>

      <description>Intro This is the first of the many reviews I will be posting of the much loved Mahabharat television series that aired on DD National when I did not even exist.
I will try to post here weekly, and before each discussion, we will have a recap of what went on last time in this epic story and how things are looking for our characters in this game of dharma, karma, and glory.</description>

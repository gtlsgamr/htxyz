				<h1 id="recap">Recap</h1>
<p>Previously we saw the birth of the main players in this story, the Pandavs
and Kauravs. Now we move on to the exploits of everyone&rsquo;s favorite
little god, Shree Krishna.</p>
<h1 id="the-prophecy">The Prophecy</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Meri ladai to Brahma se hai</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Taking a break from Hastinapur and the kuru vansh, we are introduced to
Kansa, the prince of Mathura as he overthrows his father and takes over the
royal throne.</p>
<p>He arranges for the marriage of his sister Devaki and his friend Vasudev.
After the wedding, a sage stops their chariot and talks about a prophecy
that the eighth child of Vasudev and Devaki will be the end of Kansa&rsquo;s
tyranny. Naturally Kansa plans to kill them, but Vasudev convinces him to
imprison both of them and kill their children one by one.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>This episode was more like a prologue to the story of Shri Krishna. It does not
have much in the name of content like the previous one but since I have started
this series and plan to finish it, I will write a review for this one as well.
Kansa is instantly recognizable as the personification of evil. The evil that
does not have any justification of it&rsquo;s actions other than the fact that it
just is. Even though on some occasions we see the human side of him, it is
quickly covered up by his immeasurable cruelty.</p>

<p>He imprisons the same sister that he just happily married to his best friend
without second thought. Kansa is comically evil, almost as if he is a satirical
character. In this show, that is. In the actual story, he had better
motivations and justifiable actions. He is also shown as having a god complex, a
mere mortal picking a fight with gods. The prophecy will obviously come true
and we will see the death of him, but at one point you also want to see what
plans he comes up with to fight god.</p>
<p>The past two episodes have been lackluster and I sincerely hope that future
ones come up to be better than what we got here. It gets hard to squeeze out content
if there is nothing to squeeze it out of. Maybe I will merge a few episodes if need be.</p>

<p>Manushya ka sabse bada dushman krodh hai, kyunki krodh sabse pehle tark ki hatyaa karta hai</p>

      <description>tidytilde, a script to make your $HOME clean and tidy. Sometimes your $HOME directory gets too cluttered with .dotfiles and it just looks very unclean. Fortunately the archwiki has a nice article on how to make it tidy. tidytilde automates many of the dotfiles listed there, and since it is a long list, it might be a while before all the files are implemented. You just need to run the script and it will move the files to the necessary location and create a file called tidytilde_commands in your $HOME directory which will contain all the environment variables and aliases that need to be set at startup.</description>

      <description>Ti-tty a command line time tracking shell script This is a time tracking shell script, used to track time for ongoing projects or some other task that needs time tracking. It uses unix timestamp and the date utility that comes with most unix-like operating systems. It is lightweight, and does one thing well, track time. It is similar to Timewarrior but the difference is in the implementation, as in timewarrior is too complex for my use case.</description>

      <description>tidytilde, a script to make your $HOME clean and tidy. Sometimes your $HOME directory gets too cluttered with .dotfiles and it just looks very unclean. Fortunately the archwiki has a nice article on how to make it tidy. tidytilde automates many of the dotfiles listed there, and since it is a long list, it might be a while before all the files are implemented. You just need to run the script and it will move the files to the necessary location and create a file called tidytilde_commands in your $HOME directory which will contain all the environment variables and aliases that need to be set at startup.</description>

      <description>There was this issue that I faced in my system (HP Pavilion Gaming 15 Laptop) in which the touchpad (ElanTech) would stop working when the laptop booted, the fix to which was to move my finger on the touchpad when the system was booting up. Doing this every time was not convenient, so it took me a while, but this is what I did.
Create a script, called touchpadrestart.sh and put the below code in it.</description>

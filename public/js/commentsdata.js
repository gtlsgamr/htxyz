Itemized lists\nlook like:\n\n  * this one\n  * that one\n  * the other one\n\nNote that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text\ncontent starts at 4-columns in.\n\n> Block quotes are\n> written like so.\n>\n> They can span multiple paragraphs,\n> if you like.\n\nUse 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., \"it's all\nin chapters 12--14\"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.\nUnicode is supported. â˜º\n\n\n\nAn h2 header\n------------\n\nHere's a numbered list:\n\n 1. first item\n 2. second item\n 3. third item\n\nNote again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters\nfrom the left side). Here's a code sample:\n\n    # Let me re-iterate ...\n    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }\n\nAs you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of\nindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:\n\n~~~\ndefine foobar() {\n    print \"Welcome to flavor country!\";\n}\n~~~\n "},

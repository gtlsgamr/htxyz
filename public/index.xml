      <description>When a tree dies
The wayward souls lose their shade.
Their shade is no more, Neither is the cold whistling of the wind which moves the leaves- A lullaby to listening ears</description>

      <description>like alcohol in the stone pits hailed, wanted, but lonely. In limbo, unhinged from reality thinking about the skies, while baffled by morality.
I scoured the universe, in search of salvation while my god&amp;rsquo;s abode was in my soul&amp;rsquo;s foundation.</description>

      <description>उदासी तुझमें है, तनहाई मेरे भी अंदर है, लोग वही है, समय बस अलग है। काल चक्र का कोई जादू सा मंतर है। कैसे बताऊं मै? कोई अदृश्य अक्षर है। बातें वही है, बस शब्दों में कुछ अंतर है।</description>

      <description>Universes die. Then what am I? A measly human, a small fry.
Life gives and life takes. And the rest of it, death rakes. Civilizations are devoured, Myths forgotten, Languages are lost In the jaws of time.</description>

      <description>First Post This is the first post in what I hope will be a long list of many. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to start a blog. It means I could have a place of my own, a place where my opinions are not owned by anyone else other than me.</description>

      <description>I was an atheist in the past. It was less because of my personal beliefs and more because all the cool kids did it, but other than that, my religion was liberal in that matter.</description>

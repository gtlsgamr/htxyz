      <description>Universes die. Then what am I? A measly human, a small fry.
Life gives and life takes. And the rest of it, death rakes. Civilizations are devoured, Myths forgotten, Languages are lost In the jaws of time.</description>

      <description>First Post This is the first post in what I hope will be a long list of many. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to start a blog. It means I could have a place of my own, a place where my opinions are not owned by anyone else other than me.</description>

      <description>I was an atheist in the past. It was less because of my personal beliefs and more because all the cool kids did it, but other than that, my religion was liberal in that matter.</description>

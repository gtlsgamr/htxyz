Halt the boat, for the time is now To burn the place down Look around, You&amp;rsquo;ll see pretentious pussies Pasting pointless posts on Pedantic positivity and preposterous presumptions For perverted pathetic, Pussies. Consumed by the love for Quirks and bizzare things Things that are never real, never been. Eyes like sacks of sand hanging heavy On faces who&amp;rsquo;ve seen some shit.</description>

      <description>We sit here Alone, broken Bashed into, forsaken. An eternity we have longed For the steam of kettle To turn into a song And the noisy waterfall of a fiery hot drink To Fill our leaking bases Before we go extinct. Instead, harsh rain fills us Every few months or so And we let it molest us We have nowhere to go But we will have our day We ignore what the commode And the broken cars say After all they&amp;rsquo;re trash Their purpose long fulfilled And we&amp;rsquo;re broken teacups in a junkyard Waiting to be filled.</description>

      <description>How I made my own commenting engine Well, before you go on, you might be wondering, what is a commenting engine? A commenting engine is a piece of code that handles comments on a website or app and the likes. On this website, before this point, there was no option for comments. After that I tried messing with some commenting engines such as Disqus and Staticman and many more. My core issue with most of these was that either they were hosted by third party, or they needed some sort of hosting by the site owner.</description>

      <description>Recap Now that the reign of Shantanu is over, we move on to bigger things. Things that will set in motion one of the biggest wars to take place in India. Bhishma, now the protector of the princes Chitrangad and Vichitravir as well as the kingdom, now holds the court by proxy.
Amba, Ambika, Ambalika  Ghatnaao aur durghatnaao ke paas koi ichchhashakti nahi hoti

      <description>Recap After a two weeks of inactivity, here I am again. Two weeks ago we saw how Devvrat was ready to give up worldly pleasures just so his father can stay happy and in turn, the kingdom of Hastinapur can prosper. His vow of celibacy was called Bhishma or terrible. Moving on let&amp;rsquo;s see how Shantanu tries to justify his son taking up celibacy for his father.
Ichchha Mrityu  &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;shanti aur ashanti ke daurahe par khada ye Shantanu tumhe ye vardaan deta hai.</description>

      <description>Recap Back to the story after a very uneventful episode, this is a turning point in the story of Devvrat and Shantanu, and on a larger scale the kingdom of Hastinapur. We saw Ganga tell Shantanu why she did what she did (infanticide), which was merciful in a way. Shantanu waits for about 16 years for his son to get his training and come back, prepped to be heir in the democratic kingdom of Hastinapur.</description>

      <description>Recap In the previous episode, we had a brief look at the life of King Shantanu, and his river/wife/queen Ganga. We saw her kill their newborn babies one after another, while Shantanu watched helplessly. While the reason is unknown, we can imagine that the heartless killings must have some substance to them. Why else would a mother kill seven of her newborns? In this episode we will see Shantanu choose between his love for his wife and his love for his children that don&amp;rsquo;t get to see a day of life.</description>

      <description>Recap Last we saw king Bharat establish a new trend of choosing the ruler by merit and not by right of birth. Many years have passed since then and now we look at another king of Hastinapur, Shantanu.
The wedding of Shantanu  To ek vachan dijiye.
  Aaj se mere saare vachan tumhare
 Shantanu, who is out to hunt deer (because that&amp;rsquo;s what kings do in their free time) spots a beautiful lady come out of a river.</description>

      <description>Shri Hanuman is the epitome of selfless service, courage, hope and strength. He is, and should be an inspiration to us all in more that one ways. Even for those who don&amp;rsquo;t believe in him, his story is one with valuable life lessons.
Unfathomable innocence has always been a defining character of Shri Hanuman, according to me. Since he was a child, his childish innocent actions never let the devotee/reader think that they&amp;rsquo;re reading/thinking about a literal god.</description>

      <description>When a tree dies
The wayward souls lose their shade.
Their shade is no more, Neither is the cold whistling of the wind which moves the leaves- A lullaby to listening ears
Listening ears still long for it the rustling leaves and chirping birds. The support to lay their back on- All gone when a tree dies.
When a tree dies
His son takes up the role. He&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to cry, or mourn, or show weakness.</description>

      <description>like alcohol in the stone pits hailed, wanted, but lonely. In limbo, unhinged from reality thinking about the skies, while baffled by morality.
I scoured the universe, in search of salvation while my god&amp;rsquo;s abode was in my soul&amp;rsquo;s foundation.
like mangoes in cardboard boxes sweet, free from paradoxes In heaven, hinged to reality thinking about the world unbothered by mortality.</description>

      <description>There was this issue that I faced in my system (HP Pavilion Gaming 15 Laptop) in which the touchpad (ElanTech) would stop working when the laptop booted, the fix to which was to move my finger on the touchpad when the system was booting up. Doing this every time was not convenient, so it took me a while, but this is what I did.
Create a script, called touchpadrestart.sh and put the below code in it.</description>

      <description>I was an atheist in the past. It was less because of my personal beliefs and more because all the cool kids did it, but other than that, my religion was liberal in that matter. It allowed us to do as we wish, to follow who we want.
Not knowing what it was to have someone to look to for support, someone who you have never met irl and yet they are the strongest power you know, is something that I only realized after I got out of the atheist phase.</description>

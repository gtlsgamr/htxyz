      <description>tidytilde, a script to make your $HOME clean and tidy. Sometimes your $HOME directory gets too cluttered with .dotfiles and it just looks very unclean. Fortunately the archwiki has a nice article on how to make it tidy. tidytilde automates many of the dotfiles listed there, and since it is a long list, it might be a while before all the files are implemented. You just need to run the script and it will move the files to the necessary location and create a file called tidytilde_commands in your $HOME directory which will contain all the environment variables and aliases that need to be set at startup.</description>

      <description>Ti-tty a command line time tracking shell script This is a time tracking shell script, used to track time for ongoing projects or some other task that needs time tracking. It uses unix timestamp and the date utility that comes with most unix-like operating systems. It is lightweight, and does one thing well, track time. It is similar to Timewarrior but the difference is in the implementation, as in timewarrior is too complex for my use case.</description>

      <description>Hugo-htxyz [Hugo](gohugo.io) is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.  Hugo has multiple themes that can be used to generate static sites. The sites can be minimal or pretty much full fledged, depending on the templates and the build time is FAST. Since I have been using a hugo for a while, I thought I should make my own theme.</description>

I have added multiple shots from the episodes to let the reader familiarize themselves with the theme and tone of these episodes.</description>

Spread fear and slap lies on my face like some whore What you say is not what you do What you say is not true And I&amp;rsquo;m not a puppet To be controlled by your singing strings So please, Listen to me.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful out here at night. You should come see it sometime.
The roads are empty, Streetlights burn bright The cold seeps through your heart And yet the fire inside fights.
Problems are a matter of tomorrow. This is your time to live Forget your sorrows At least until this time you borrowed Runs out, and before you know it, It&amp;rsquo;s over. Guns out Time to fight that war again, Time to be reborn again.</description>

      <description>like alcohol in the stone pits hailed, wanted, but lonely. In limbo, unhinged from reality thinking about the skies, while baffled by morality.
I scoured the universe, in search of salvation while my god&amp;rsquo;s abode was in my soul&amp;rsquo;s foundation.
like mangoes in cardboard boxes sweet, free from paradoxes In heaven, hinged to reality thinking about the world unbothered by mortality.</description>

      <description>Do cavemen dream of stormy skies, spread far and wide? Do they cower in fear of what lies within? Or hope that its all a fever dream, and hide their heads in their mother’s laps, peeking between their fingergaps.
Do cavemen dream of cheery weather? And Singing birds with flashy feathers? Clear skies, fluffy clouds where they could shout their truth aloud. Or do they live just like us? In fear of what we must become, to live out till seventy one and lose the will to have some fun.</description>

      <description>On lonely nights I think of you and take a drive down degenerate lane. The tar becomes your skin, solid, but soothing. Your eyes are the stars watching me from afar. While sex appeal drips drowsily from your lips on my windshield, just for me to wipe it off. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how long I drive, your threads keep unraveling strand after strand covering me with your scent until there&amp;rsquo;s no air left for me to breathe.</description>

      <description>I dream to see land And flying seagulls on the shore This sea now sickens me No more I want to explore.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in it No ship to sail in The sun has sucked me dry No tears left, yet I keep wailing.
They romanticize the ocean Talk about exploring the unexplored But in looking at the sun The dark waters they ignore
Yes, hope is an ocean With water infinite But what&amp;rsquo;s the point of it?</description>

      <description>A text here A picture there Crumpled up into moments we shared.
I would say fuck you But I have tested my luck too And kept failing to obscure you.
We shared a history With an emphasis on the D I&amp;rsquo;m not glued to you anymore, I&amp;rsquo;m free.
Consolations of being each other&amp;rsquo;s walls You dug your way in my heart&amp;rsquo;s halls But unlike you, your lies were tall.
We&amp;rsquo;re done now, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen you through I say we shared a history, like it&amp;rsquo;s true But it seems like only I shared it with you</description>

शब्द कम पड़ जाते है तेरे एहसान गिनाने में आज एक दिन वो कर पाएगा चंद अफसाने गाने से?
फिर भी आज बैठकर कुछ कोशिश मै कर रहा हूं, कुछ कर दिखाऊं उससे पहले तुझे खोने से मै डर रहा हूं।

But only some of them deserve their roles, In my trampled, stampled life. This road might fork one day Or go on forever, A dead end might come anytime, If I don&amp;rsquo;t get clever. I am but a mere Traveller, On this dusty, winding road ; And I still wish the journey would get lively Like my little pet toad.</description>

      <description>I wanted you to know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering lately. If I ever lose you, Who&amp;rsquo;s going to berate me?
Who&amp;rsquo;s going to mock me, For not being social? For always being disappointing, For never being hopeful.
I know I try too hard, It&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re my idol Even though you&amp;rsquo;re broken Barely hanging on, suicidal.
I try to find the good in you, yet to see it somewhere. But I fear that one rainy morning, You won&amp;rsquo;t be there, to not be there.</description>

      <description>This life that i lead figured out, but really not My face is winning this race, Although my face lies a lot.
Lies, thrown right on your face, Sweet vanilla cake frosting And yet in my sincerest thoughts These lies are pretty exhausting
You swarm right in my home suck on my honey-coated lies and you&amp;rsquo;ll keep barging in Until you&amp;rsquo;ve sucked me dry.
Brainwashed bees still bust in my halls Of tense, morbid thoughts.</description>

      <description>This turmoil I feel, Is it made up or is it real?
I hear things, Faint ringing of a lost song Eternally plagued By a past long gone.
I want to take on the path less taken. But what if it&amp;rsquo;s not? What if I&amp;rsquo;m mistaken?
Barely hanging on, I&amp;rsquo;m fighting this curse. but I find my solace in penning this verse.
Monotonous, malignant musings of a mediocre mind.</description>

I hope that you talk and I could tell you What I need
But jokes and insults are all I recieve. Two quick beats miss a step Then repeat I wish I could Stop acting Like a little kid.</description>

      <description>We sit here Alone, broken Bashed into, forsaken. An eternity we have longed For the steam of kettle To turn into a song And the noisy waterfall of a fiery hot drink To Fill our leaking bases Before we go extinct. Instead, harsh rain fills us Every few months or so And we let it molest us We have nowhere to go But we will have our day We ignore what the commode And the broken cars say After all they&amp;rsquo;re trash Their purpose long fulfilled And we&amp;rsquo;re broken teacups in a junkyard Waiting to be filled.</description>

      <description>Gunships crash And burn into nothingness, Following this ritual eternally Until the heavenly fires Burn it all. And what&amp;rsquo;s left will be Nothing at all.
Warriors clash And Strike their blades blunt, Fighting till their last breath Until their commander Says stop. And the war that began Forever stays stalled.
Violence stays Forever in my heart. Slurping my soul, skulking about. And No matter how hard I try To wrench it out It won&amp;rsquo;t leave my soul Until I battle it out.</description>

      <description>2:27, The time without time. Seconds pass slowly, Minutes are stuck forever And Hours don&amp;rsquo;t exist. What I am now Is what I used to be Before I became this whirling vortex Of vain existence and the same sorrows Ever persistent. I fumble with the sheets To no avail, Sleep doesn&amp;rsquo;t come easy to me Not at night, at least. When in doing my chores It comes sudden And treats me like a whore.</description>

      <description>When a tree dies
The wayward souls lose their shade.
Their shade is no more, Neither is the cold whistling of the wind Which moves the leaves A lullaby to listening ears
Listening ears still long for it The rustling leaves, chirping birds, The support to lay their back on All gone when a tree dies
When a tree dies
His son takes up the role. He&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to cry, Or mourn, or show weakness.</description>

      <description>I wrote for you. Wasted a thousand words, Filled up a million notes for you.
I showed you my work, I bared what was left of me Broke my mind penning it down, Just to feel that hit of ecstacy.
I poured my heart out. Cliché? I know. Rephrase. I put my soul out and let it wander The white sea of my pages. I let it write free of judgement Beautiful, broken, repugnant.</description>

      <description>Recap After a two weeks of inactivity, here I am again. Two weeks ago we saw how Devvrat was ready to give up worldly pleasures just so his father can stay happy and in turn, the kingdom of Hastinapur can prosper. His vow of celibacy was called Bhishma or terrible. Moving on let&amp;rsquo;s see how Shantanu tries to justify his son taking up celibacy for his father.
Ichchha Mrityu  &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;shanti aur ashanti ke daurahe par khada ye Shantanu tumhe ye vardaan deta hai.</description>

      <description>Recap Back to the story after a very uneventful episode, this is a turning point in the story of Devvrat and Shantanu, and on a larger scale the kingdom of Hastinapur. We saw Ganga tell Shantanu why she did what she did (infanticide), which was merciful in a way. Shantanu waits for about 16 years for his son to get his training and come back, prepped to be heir in the democratic kingdom of Hastinapur.</description>

      <description>Recap In the previous episode, we had a brief look at the life of King Shantanu, and his river/wife/queen Ganga. We saw her kill their newborn babies one after another, while Shantanu watched helplessly. While the reason is unknown, we can imagine that the heartless killings must have some substance to them. Why else would a mother kill seven of her newborns? In this episode we will see Shantanu choose between his love for his wife and his love for his children that don&amp;rsquo;t get to see a day of life.</description>

The wedding of Shantanu  To ek vachan dijiye.
  Aaj se mere saare vachan tumhare

      <description>Shri Hanuman is the epitome of selfless service, courage, hope and strength. He is, and should be an inspiration to us all in more that one ways. Even for those who don&amp;rsquo;t believe in him, his story is one with valuable life lessons.
Unfathomable innocence has always been a defining character of Shri Hanuman, according to me. Since he was a child, his childish innocent actions never let the devotee/reader think that they&amp;rsquo;re reading/thinking about a literal god.</description>

      <description>There was this issue that I faced in my system (HP Pavilion Gaming 15 Laptop) in which the touchpad (ElanTech) would stop working when the laptop booted, the fix to which was to move my finger on the touchpad when the system was booting up. Doing this every time was not convenient, so it took me a while, but this is what I did.
Create a script, called touchpadrestart.sh and put the below code in it.</description>

      <description>I was an atheist in the past. It was less because of my personal beliefs and more because all the cool kids did it, but other than that, my religion was liberal in that matter. It allowed us to do as we wish, to follow who we want.
Not knowing what it was to have someone to look to for support, someone who you have never met irl and yet they are the strongest power you know, is something that I only realized after I got out of the atheist phase.</description>

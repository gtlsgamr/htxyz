> Aaj se mera jeevan tumhare liye, Meri Nishtha tumhari, aur meri mrityu bhi tumhari hi hogi.

#### Synopsis
The princes return to Hastinapur and take part in a competition designed to
show off their skills. They all introduce themselves in front of king
Dhritrashtra, while Kunti narrates the happenings to a bling Gandhari.
Yudishthir fights all the princes at once and defeats them subsequently. Bheem
and Duryodhan fight with _gadas_, and have to be seperated when the fight turns
serious. Arjun steals the show with his magical arrow skills, summoning the
four elements from the sky using the arrows. Karna comes to challenge Arjun,
but is denied a fair fight by the elders using various excuses. At one point
Duryodhan makes Karna the king of _ang_ kingdom, but Karna is still denied a
shot at the competition.

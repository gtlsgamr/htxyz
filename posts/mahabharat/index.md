##### Mahabharat
<details>
<summary>This is a review series for the hit TV show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158417/">Mahabharat</a>.
</summary>
<p>
It is close to my heart as
it was being rerun when I was a child and I remember watching it everyday. This
series started as an attempt to provide a reading companion with the TV series.
It is inspired by Alan Sepinwall's reviews for *The wire*. Of course, both the shows
are vastly different, but I think I will be able to do this justice. This show is about
the Indian epic Mahabharat, and it is nearly identical with the source material, with a few
hiccups here and there. It is ingrained in the culture of India as the show that
everyone watched when they were kids. No matter the generation, at some point in time 
this show has always aired on TV since 1988. I hope these episode reviews will
serve 
as a faithful reading companion when you watch the show. 

**P.S. These reviews only cover the actual show with 94 episodes and not the
pre-sequel-prequels that came in the 90s because they were clearly a cashgrab
riding on the success of the original.**

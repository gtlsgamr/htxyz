#### Yuvraj Yudhishthir

> Kal ki pratiksha kisi veer ko shobha nahi deti. Veer to samay ki chattan ko kaat kar kal ki moorti bana lete hain.

#### Synopsis 
The court meets to name the Heir Apparent to the throne of Hastinapur.
Jarasandh asks Bheeshmak to invite Shishupal, the Chedi King, to marry his
daughter Rukmani and make Shishupal his ally. Rukmani sends a letter to Shri Krishna
whom she loves, to rescue her.

#### Discussion 
This was an episode that I find very difficult to rate objectively. On one
hand, it moves a major plot point forward: Yudhishthir being crowned as
heir-apparent. On the other hand, I have next to nothing to put in the _Notable
Dialogue_ section. It is a dull episode, dialogue wise. We do get to meet a lot
of new characters, and all of those are introduced in the _samay_ monologue. So
if you usually skip those... you might be clueless in the latter half of the
episode. 


- **Bhishmak**: The king of _Vidarbh_ kingdom and the father of Rukmani. He is
  friends with Magadh-Naresh Jarasandh. 
- **Rukmi**: Brother of Rukmani and son of Bhishmak. He wants to marry Rukmani
  to his friend Shishupal.
- **Rukmani**: Daughter of Bhishmak. She loves Shri Krishna and is opposed to
  marrying Shishupal.
- **Shishupal**: _Chedi_ king. Friend of Rukmi and wants to marry Rukmani.

Dhritrashtra takes the safe route and crowns Yudhishthir as heir-apparent after
Yudhishthir displays his excellent decision making skills. You could
practically hear the pain when he asked Bhishma to blow the conch that will
crown Yudhishthir as heir-apparent.

Meanwhile on the other front, Rukmani writes a letter to Shri Krishna, asking
him to rescue her, which is shown in a song format. The song is nice, but it
gets repetitive after a while.

Now that Yudhishthir has been crowned heir-apparent, we should see some more
movement from what I like to call the three musketeers. Duryodhan, Dushasan and
Karna, lead by MamaShri Shakuni. Karna's belief in making Duryodhan king is
steadfast as ever, and he will try his very best to fulfill that wish.

We also get to meet a grown up Eklavya, who bears nothing but devotion for his
Guru Dronacharya. He is now a sidekick of Jarasandh, and tirelessly works for him. 
That is all for today, lets hope that I can continue this series until the end!

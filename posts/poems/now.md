I see light-headed hipsters high on      
Sensationalized trends      
Performing ecstatical stunts      
Fueled by purposeless strength.      
Halt the boat, for the time is now      
To burn the place down      
Look around,      
You'll see pretentious pussies      
Pasting pointless posts on      
Pedantic positivity and      
preposterous presumptions      
For perverted pathetic,      
Pussies.      
Consumed by the love for      
Quirks and bizzare things      
Things that are never real, never been.      
Eyes like sacks of sand hanging heavy      
On faces who've seen some shit.      
"Still want that black coffee though,      
Because black is lit"      
Black defines shit,      
It defines your thirst for being the      
Centre of an ever-changing caravan      
You ache for attention that you never deserved      
But you are a slave      
Bred and fed to serve      
The constant stream of garbage      
Spewn by social snakes.      
You follow trends like commandments      
written in long lost languages,      
They're temporary, so are you      
But who are you?

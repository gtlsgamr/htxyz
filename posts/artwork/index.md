Back in college, I learned photoshop out of curiosity and proceeded to make
some artwork that I think is pretty good. The themes include photographs taken
by me during my stay in Ahmedabad and pop culture icons that were influential
in my upbringing. I relied heavily on vaporwave themes for most of the artwork.
Many of these pictures are also entirely made from scratch by me.

#### Hi, I am Hitarth Thummar. 
Welcome to my personal webspace.

<!-- homepagepointer -->

This is a place where I plan to share everything that
I find interesting, amusing, helpful or worth sharing. I am a software
enthusiast who spends *a lot* of his time on a computer. I write software from
time to time. It may or may not be your definition of "free" but yes most of
the time it is licensed under a copyleft license. I write reviews for old Indian TV shows
from time to time. Currently I am working on Mahabharat(1988).

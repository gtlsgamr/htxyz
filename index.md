+++
## hi, 
Welcome to my personal webspace.

<!-- homepagepointer -->

This is a place where I plan to share everything that
I find interesting, amusing, helpful or worth sharing. 

I write reviews for old Indian TV shows
from time to time.

Currently I am working on Mahabharat(1988). 
This website is made using a [script](https://git.hitarththummar.xyz/htxyz/about/) that
generates static html pages from markdown files.

I wrote for you.     
Wasted a thousand words,     
Filled up a million notes for you.     
     
I showed you my work,     
I bared what was left of me     
Broke my mind penning it down,     
Just to feel that hit of ecstacy.     
     
I poured my heart out.     
Clich√©? I know.     
Rephrase.     
I put my soul out and let it wander     
The white sea of my pages.     
I let it write free of judgement     
Beautiful, broken, repugnant.     
And once it was done     
I put it back in.     
Eternally caged,     
until my heart broke again.

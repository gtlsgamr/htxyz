I passed through     
the biting winds of winter     
igniting fires of a furious summer     
broken dreams of burning leaves     
and the sweet sweet fruit of spring.     
winds of desperation biting my face.     
running limbless in this life's race.     
failing, losing and cursing myself     
in the end, discovering new ways     
to pass through.

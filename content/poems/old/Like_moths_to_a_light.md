It's okay to forgive yourself     
To relax, sit back     
And heal yourself.     
     
Short lifespan     
We're like moths to a light     
Flying fast, burning bright.     
Trying in vain to reach new heights     
But that's alright.     
     
There will be blockades     
All through this journey,     
And whenever you're down     
You know you can always call me.     
     
My rhyming scheme is     
All over the place     
And when I'm failing at life     
I no longer try and save face.     
We need to replace     
This stigma of society     
That being drunk     
Is in any way worse than sobriety     
Because like moths to a light     
Flying fast, burning bright     
You are allowed to fall sometimes     
But you aren't allowed to leave this fight.     
     
So keep fighting my man     
And fight your way out     
Leave the whole world aside     
And make yourself proud.

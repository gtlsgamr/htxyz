I love you, you loved me     
i'm riding alone, it's just me     
Side mirror loose, adjust it     
Betrayel lane, injustice     
Your colored smoke, engulfs me     
I breathe it in, I'm set free     
You are a magic entity     
Your cheap tricks disgust me     
I'm smoking a cheap cigar     
No beerbongs and bentleys     
You act like the 80s     
A little coked up, a bit carefree     
I am a lonely masochist     
Inflict pain, I'll love it     
The side mirror of my ride     
it was loose, you cracked it.

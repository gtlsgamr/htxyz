like alcohol in the stone pits     
hailed, wanted, but lonely.     
In limbo, unhinged from reality     
thinking about the skies,     
while baffled by morality.     
     
I scoured the universe,     
in search of salvation     
while my god's abode     
was in my soul's foundation.     
     
like mangoes in cardboard boxes     
sweet, free from paradoxes     
In heaven, hinged to reality     
thinking about the world     
unbothered by mortality.

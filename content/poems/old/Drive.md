On lonely nights     
I think of you     
and take a drive     
down degenerate lane.     
The tar becomes your skin,     
solid, but soothing.     
Your eyes are the stars     
watching me from afar.     
While sex appeal     
drips drowsily     
from your lips     
on my windshield,     
just for me to wipe it off.     
It doesn't matter     
how long I drive,     
your threads keep unraveling     
strand after strand     
covering me with your scent     
until there's no air     
left for me to breathe.     
That's my cue,     
time to leave.

Two quick beats,     
miss a step     
then repeat.     
My heart does that     
when your touch     
it needs.     
I cry and I     
Plead, and I     
Beg on my knees,     
But all you do     
is laugh at me and lie     
and deceive     
     
I hope that you talk     
and I could tell you     
What I need     
     
But jokes     
and insults     
are all I recieve.     
Two quick beats     
miss a step     
Then repeat     
I wish I could     
Stop acting     
Like a little kid.

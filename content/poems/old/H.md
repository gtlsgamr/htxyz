I'm not what I used to be anymore,     
Hiding behind tasteless humor.     
I don't write     
I haven't read a book in forever     
My life is a slimy mix     
Of caffeine, nicotine and THC     
All day I roam the streets     
I can't sleep at nights     
I keep messing with the bed sheets     
Fuck it! I'll be happy from tommorow     
I keep lying to myself     
Can't hide behind those lies anymore.     
My notes app is a collection of empty notes     
Half written poems     
Which I don't intend to finish     
Even this poem is shit     
I know     
But I needed to let it out     
Let the world know     
I'm not what I used to be anymore

Gunships crash     
And burn into nothingness,     
Following this ritual eternally     
Until the heavenly fires     
Burn it all.     
And what's left will be     
Nothing at all.     
     
Warriors clash     
And Strike their blades blunt,     
Fighting till their last breath     
Until their commander     
Says stop.     
And the war that began     
Forever stays stalled.     
     
Violence stays     
Forever in my heart.     
Slurping my soul, skulking about.     
And No matter how hard I try     
To wrench it out     
It won't leave my soul     
Until I battle it out.

When a tree dies     
     
The wayward souls     
lose their shade.     
     
Their shade is no more,     
Neither is the cold whistling of the wind     
Which moves the leaves     
A lullaby to listening ears     
     
Listening ears still long for it     
The rustling leaves, chirping birds,     
The support to lay their back on     
All gone when a tree dies     
     
When a tree dies     
     
His son takes up the role.     
He's not supposed to cry,     
Or mourn, or show weakness.     
     
He becomes the shade,     
The support, the rustling of leaves     
He becomes what his father was     
     
When the tree dies     
The seed is seed no more     
He has to grow     
No matter if he's ready or not.     
     
Until the next tree dies.

This life that i lead     
figured out, but really not     
My face is winning this race,     
Although my face lies a lot.     
     
Lies, thrown right on your face,     
Sweet vanilla cake frosting     
And yet in my sincerest thoughts     
These lies are pretty exhausting     
     
You swarm right in my home     
suck on my honey-coated lies     
and you'll keep barging in     
Until you've sucked me dry.     
     
Brainwashed bees still bust in my halls     
Of tense, morbid thoughts.     
and I'm still trying to figure this out     
but in the end, I'm really not.

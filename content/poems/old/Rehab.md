This turmoil I feel,     
Is it made up or is it real?     
     
I hear things,     
Faint ringing of a lost song     
Eternally plagued     
By a past long gone.     
     
I want to take on     
the path less taken.     
But what if it's not?     
What if I'm mistaken?     
     
Barely hanging on,     
I'm fighting this curse.     
but I find my solace     
in penning this verse.     
     
Monotonous, malignant musings     
of a mediocre mind.

Decibels upon decibels     
of your absence uncalled for.     
Blind ears and deaf eyes     
of leaders I vote for.     
Spread fear and slap lies     
on my face like some whore     
What you say is not what you do     
What you say is not true     
And I'm not a puppet     
To be controlled     
by your singing strings     
So please,     
Listen to me.     
Stop your vendetta     
and this societal violence     
And add noise     
To your deafening silence

I am but a mere Traveller     
On a dusty winding road,     
With only a box of feelings     
And my pet toad.     
I met many people, many strangers,     
Many foes.     
But only some of them deserve their roles,     
In my trampled, stampled life.     
This road might fork one day     
Or go on forever,     
A dead end might come anytime,     
If I don't get clever.     
I am but a mere Traveller,     
On this dusty, winding road ;     
And I still wish the journey would get lively     
Like my little pet toad.

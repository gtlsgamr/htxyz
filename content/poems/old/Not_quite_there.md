I wanted you to know,     
I've been wondering lately.     
If I ever lose you,     
Who's going to berate me?     
     
Who's going to mock me,     
For not being social?     
For always being disappointing,     
For never being hopeful.     
     
I know I try too hard,     
It's because you're my idol     
Even though you're broken     
Barely hanging on, suicidal.     
     
I try to find the good in you,     
yet to see it somewhere.     
But I fear that one rainy morning,     
You won't be there, to not be there.

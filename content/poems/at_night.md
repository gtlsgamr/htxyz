It's beautiful out here at night.     
You should come see it sometime.     
     
The roads are empty,     
Streetlights burn bright     
The cold seeps through your heart     
And yet the fire inside fights.     
     
Problems are a matter of tomorrow.     
This is your time to live     
Forget your sorrows     
At least until this time you borrowed     
Runs out,     
and before you know it,     
It's over. Guns out     
Time to fight that war again,     
Time to be reborn again.     
Time to get up and be thrown again     
at life,     
The seeds of solitude are sown again.     
Sun rises, you die inside     
Until night falls again.     
     
It's beautiful out here at night.     
You should come see it sometime.

I dream to see land     
And flying seagulls on the shore     
This sea now sickens me     
No more I want to explore.     
     
Now I'm stuck in it     
No ship to sail in     
The sun has sucked me dry     
No tears left, yet I keep wailing.     
     
They romanticize the ocean     
Talk about exploring the unexplored     
But in looking at the sun     
The dark waters they ignore     
     
Yes, hope is an ocean     
With water infinite     
But what's the point of it?     
If you're drowning in it.

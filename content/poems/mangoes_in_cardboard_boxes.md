like alcohol in the stone pits    
hailed, wanted, but lonely.    
In limbo, unhinged from reality    
thinking about the skies,    
while baffled by morality.    

I scoured the universe,     
in search of salvation    
while my god's abode    
was in my soul's foundation.    

like mangoes in cardboard boxes    
sweet, free from paradoxes    
In heaven, hinged to reality    
thinking about the world    
unbothered by mortality.

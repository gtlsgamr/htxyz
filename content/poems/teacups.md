We sit here    
Alone, broken    
Bashed into, forsaken.    
An eternity we have longed    
For the steam of kettle     
To turn into a song    
And the noisy waterfall    
of a fiery hot drink     
To Fill our leaking bases     
Before we go extinct.      
Instead, harsh rain fills us     
Every few months or so     
And we let it molest us     
We have nowhere to go     
But we will have our day      
We ignore what the commode      
And the broken cars say      
After all they're trash       
Their purpose long fulfilled        
And we're broken teacups      
in a junkyard      
Waiting to be filled.

2:27,     
The time without time.     
Seconds pass slowly,     
Minutes are stuck forever     
And Hours don't exist.     
What I am now     
Is what I used to be     
Before I became     
this whirling vortex     
Of vain existence     
and the same sorrows     
Ever persistent.     
I fumble with the sheets     
To no avail,     
Sleep doesn't come easy to me     
Not at night, at least.     
When in doing my chores     
It comes sudden     
And treats me like a whore.     
I think of my past romances,     
Friends I made     
The ones I lost     
Not forever, I hope.     
But it's still pointless     
This unreasonable pursuit     
Of a good night's sleep.

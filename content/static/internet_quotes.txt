Some internet quotes/posts that I find interesting:

=-> God, what has Mozilla done to itself. Like watching that friend continually
make shitty decisions over and over, refusing all help, until they destroy
themselves. ~ RandumUser31

=-> One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that, lacking zero, they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C Programs. ~ Robert Firth

 
=->	Evi rite gulaal maange che,
	Koi jaane vhaal maange che.
	Pote saaf suthra rahi ne,
	Rangva Maro gaal mange che.
		~ SNR

=->	Dig jeevan jo sehta hi aaya hai virodh,
	Dig saadhan jiske liye sada hi kiya shodh,
	Jaanki haay uddhar priya ka ho na saka,
	Par ek aur mann raha Ram ka jo na thaka.
		~ Nirala

=-> 

"Purpose" is not the answer to what you seek.

You are looking for something that brings every cell and sinew in your body into alignment.

    Something that dominates and clears your headspace.
    Something that tests your character and strength.
    Something that promises glory.
    Something that risks your future.
    Some opportunity to protect what you love.
    Some cause greater than yourself.
    Some danger that demands every hour of your day
    Some enemy to conquer

You seek war. A war, where if you win you reap Heaven. If you lose you are martyred.

Find your war. That will be your peace.

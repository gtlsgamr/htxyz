Shri Hanuman is the epitome of selfless service, courage, hope and strength. He is, and should be an inspiration to us all in more that one ways. Even for those who don't believe in him, his story is one with valuable life lessons. 

Unfathomable innocence has always been a defining character of Shri Hanuman, according to me. Since he was a child, his childish innocent actions never let the devotee/reader think that they're reading/thinking about a literal god. The very incarnation of Lord Shiva. Take for example, the incident when he tried to eat the sun, thinking it was a golden fruit. Children might think that, but gods actually try to eat it. 

Throughout the incidents narrated in Hindu scriptures, not once is Hanumanji seen to have any negative emotions. They have always been positive, bringing the devotee/reader back into a pleasant state of mind.

Talking about courage and fearlessness, almost every Indian household has seen Hanuman Chalisa being recited whenever the user is in a state of panic, stress, depression, or literally being chased by ghosts. Shri Hanuman's name itself is enough to strike fear into the hearts of one's enemies and bring peace to one's mind. It's an old saying in Indian villages, "No one can harm the devotee of a devotee.", thus, being a devotee of Shri Hanuman is a great way to live life. Free from fear, free from attachments, and always with courage in mind, strengh in arms, and Shri Ram in your heart.

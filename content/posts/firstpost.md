### First Post
This is the first post in what I hope will be a long list of many. I've always wanted to start a blog. It means I could have a place of my own, a place where my opinions are not owned by anyone else other than me. A place where censorship/fear of others doesn't exist. Hoping to add more posts here, where I can share all kinds of stuff, including art, poetry, tutorials, writings, and whatnot.

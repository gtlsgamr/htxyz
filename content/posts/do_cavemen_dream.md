# Cavemen Dream

What do cavemen think         
of stormy skies, spread far and wide?          
Do they cower in fear     
of what lies within?     
Or hope that its all a fever dream,     
and hide their heads in their mother's laps,     
peeking between their fingergaps.     

Do cavemen dream of cheery weather?     
And Singing birds with flashy feathers?     
Clear skies, fluffy clouds     
where they could shout their truth aloud.     
Or do they live just like us?     
In fear of what we must become,     
to live out till seventy one     
and lose the will to have some fun.

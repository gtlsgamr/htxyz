Universes die.    
Then what am I?    
A measly human, a small fry.    

Life gives and life takes.    
And the rest of it, death rakes.    
Civilizations are devoured,    
Myths forgotten,    
Languages are lost    
In the jaws of time.    

No one remembers    
Past two generations    
Great grandfathers:    
not so great anymore.    

Universes die.    
Then what am I?    
A measly human, a small fry.

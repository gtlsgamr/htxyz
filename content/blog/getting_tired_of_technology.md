There used to be a time when learning something new meant hours of fun. My
parents bought me an Encyclopedia as a birthday gift when I was a kid and I
spent *hours* going through each and every tidbit of information in there.
Learning used to be something to look forward to. Now don't take this post as a
vain reminiscence of the _bygone days_, it is not. It is a written form of the
thoughts that I have been having for the past few weeks. 

Learning is not fun anymore. You want to learn assembly? Just look it up on the
internet. You want to learn how to make some obscure south Indian dish? Look it
up. You want to learn about the fifth president of India? Look it up.
Every single thing that you may or may not need either right now or in the
foreseeable future is available at your fingertips, and I feel like that has taken
the fun out of it. There used to be a time when a few friends would argue about
some obscure fact that everyone remembered differently, and the discussion
would go on for hours! Unless of course a third party intervened, where it
turned out that everyone was wrong. There was a joy in small things like that.

For at least the past few years, there has been a lack of things to do, due to
the abundance of things to do. The over saturation of information the internet
has brought upon us is nothing but an endless stream of information that the
human brain sees, processes and forgets. Facts aren't facts anymore, and
opinions of people are changing faster that you can say _"frog"_. It is a
worldwide phenomenon, and it needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Every
single person is turning into a clone of every other one due to the
saturation and careful feeding of information via internet. Since everyone has
most of their experiences online, everyone grows up the same way.

Look at today's children. They are thrown into the world of internet as soon as
they can say _baa_ like sleep to slaughter. They can't live without
phones/tablets. There is no more a _need_ to find things out, because our
tech-overlords already do that for us. It pains me to see my nephews or nieces
cry out like spoiled children when their phones are taken away from them.
Parents encourage this behavior because the child won't cry if you give them
the magic shiny rectangle. This raises some serious concerns about the coming
generation. 

I used to love computers, I remember writing a substitution cipher GUI program
in java using netbeans in school just for fun. I _wanted_ to do it. But for
quite some time, it feels like that joy of learning things is gone. I want to
sit on a computer _only_ as long as it is necessary and then shut it
down. I used to be an avid gamer, I would play video games for hours. Not
anymore. Maybe I am growing up, or maybe the circumstances are truly as dire as I think
they are, but things are _definitely_ changing. I plan to move away from this
overabundance gradually, and I have already started it since the past year by Deleting
social media.

Take the first step, Rest is up to you.

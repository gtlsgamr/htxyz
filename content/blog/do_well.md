A year ago a I wrote [about doing good](https://hitarththummar.xyz/blog/do_good). Today I am writing about doing
well.

Regarding this site. The "_influx of posts_" that I promised did not happen. I
did post some things, but they were far apart. I will be sure to keep posting.
The Mahabharat series has come to a halt for now. It will complete though, one
way or another.

There are many differences between then and now. I wrote that post at night and
I am writing this one during the day. I expressed my desire to do good during
the coming years. I am not sure if my actions were _good_ this year, but I
definitely did well.

I want to be thankful to some cosmic energy that is showering its blessings
upon me. I am flourishing in my career, I got married, and I have a kid on the
way. I have shifted to a new city and growing in ways that I never thought I
could. My physical fitness is improving more and more everyday, and mentally I
have never been better. As glum as the post one year before was, I think it was
an end to the gloom. Nothing has gone wrong since then, as far as I can
remember. I am thankful for that, truly.

I guess when you do good, things go well for you by themselves.

I hope next year goes as good as mine for you, and you do _well_ in your life
too.

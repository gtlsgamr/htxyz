I loved magnets as a kid. The way they pulled and pushed each other was nothing
short of magic for me. Another thing I loved was toy mobile phones. They were
these little plastic cases with a speaker in them. The keys of the phone were
mapped to different sounds, each button would play a different song. The reason
I loved these phones was because they had little magnets in them for the
speakers. Whenever one broke, I would get a new magnet to play with. It was
like a toy inside a toy.

Cell phones were relatively new in my village at that time. My dad got one, and
to me, a mobile was a mobile. Real or toy. I just wanted the magnet man. I
pestered my mom and dad for the whole day, constantly asking for the magnet in
the mobile phone. It wasn't before long my mother showed her wrath and threw my
dad's new cellphone at a wall. "*Find the magnet*", she said. 

I couldn't.

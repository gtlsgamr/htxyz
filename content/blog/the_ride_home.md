The drive back to my home in Talala is what I will cherish the most during my
years in Gir. It just had this feel to it, I am not really sure if I can put it
into words.
Once you crossed Mendarda, there is this Hanuman temple on the right side. It
marked the beginning of the "*Journey back home*" for me. The jungle started.
Roads started getting rougher, the people sparse. Sign boards from the forest
department started popping up all over the places. You could see *Maldhaaris*
from nearby *nesdas*  selling wild berries and raw tamarind on the sides of the
road.
The only unpleasant part is the 4km stretch of single lane road before *Sasan*
with lots of speedbumps. Even that made me elated on some level because that
road meant I was closer to Sasan and hence, closer to home. Sasan itself was
not very pleasant to look at. I mean, it is a tourist hub and you know how
tourists are, but once you cross Sasan it is the BEST ride home. 
The river *Hiran* running on your right, the sun becomes a fiery ball of orange
and red. The shadows of the trees play hide and seek with your headlights while
the sweet, sweet smell of home engulfs your senses.

I would never, ever wish for any other place as my home.

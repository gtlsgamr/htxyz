So recently, we at [gnulinuxindia](https://gnulinuxindia.org) came up with our
own pubnix, ~[tildevarsh](https://tildevarsh.in). A *pubnix* is a public access unix system. A single computer that
is shared by multiple people. Now I won't go into the history of how it
started, but let me give you a brief introduction.

## What is a pubnix?
A pubnix is a shared access public unix system. Multiple users access it, use
it, administer it and generally form a community around it. The pubnix, in
return, provides several services to the users. Most common of those being:

- Shell access
- Email
- IRC server
- IRC bouncer
- A public facing website

## What is the appeal of a pubnix?
I guess for me it is the feeling of being a part of something larger than
yourself. Humans love being a part of a collective and I guess that collective
identity appeals to me. To others it might be their interest in unix-like OSes
or just general technical hobbies. While these are possible, I think the most
common appeal for these tildes are the free services.

## What is tildevarsh, and why should I be a part of it?
Tildevarsh is an India-based pubnix. 

Personally what makes tildevarsh different from other tildes is the voting
system. Members have a command in their shell called `vote` which will be used
to vote on motions going across the tilde. These motions can be started by any
member. Once the a motion receives majority votes, that change is implemented
into the server.

Will you be an ideal fit for it, or vice versa?

1. Do you like being a part of a community and contributing to it?
2. Do you have spare time on your hands to actually login more than once a week?
3. Are you passionate about such public projects?
4. Do you value community over free stuff?

If your answer was 'yes' to most of the questions above, then you might enjoy
your time in [tildevarsh](https://tildevarsh.in).

Although it says India based, people from other nationalities are more than welcome.
Hope to see you soon!

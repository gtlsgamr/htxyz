#### Pandavs leave for Hastinapur
> Mera hriday tumhare rajya jo vo bhaag hai, jise tum kabhi haar nahi sakte.

#### Synopsis 
After Arjun marries Draupadi, everyone comes to know that they are alive.
Dhritrashtra invites Pandavs to Hastinapur through Vidur, who actually
manipulated Dhritrashtra to do this. Pandavs and Shri Krishna discuss the
future and what it means for the throne of Hastinapur. Pandavs leave for
Hastinapur.

#### Discussion 
The discussion on this one is short as there is not much to be discussed.

Dhritrashtra admits that he knew who was behind the Lakshyagrah incident when
Duryodhan confronts him about inviting the Pandavs back. Dhritrashtra has no
choice but to call them back since Duryodhan and friends failed at killing him.
I have said this many times before and I will say it now, Dhritrashtra is not
blind physically but he choses to be blind to dharma. He sees that what his son
does is wrong and yet he supports him. The blind king is a symbolic name as
well. Duryodhan being the man-child that he is, threatens Dhritrashtra with
suicide again but in vain. 

Karna tries to talk some sense into Duryodhan. Tries to turn him from the dark
path, but **vinaash kaale viparit buddhi** rings true as Duryodhan does not
listen. Karna being indebted to Duryodhan, supports him no matter what his own
beliefs are. 

Dharmraj yudhishthir wants to avoid war with his own family. He is not
conflicted like Arjun is in the **Bhagawad Geeta**. Yudhishthir simply wants to
avoid war at all costs. Krishna suggests to not attack first. If you retaliate
to an attack, it is not an act of war. The war has already started. Conflicting
emotions will be a regular part of this show, as it is a show about family
first of all. No matter how dysfunctional. The background score was fantastic
again in this episode. It succeeded in making the viewer realize the gravity of
the situation.

Tensions will be high in the next episode, when Pandavs arrive at Hastinapur.
Shakuni is trying to figure out how they escaped. Vidur is trying to figure out
how to get them on the throne. Duryodhan wants the throne. Yudhishthir wants
peace. Between all these, the only person who will be stuck is Arjun and the
only person who can set him free is Shri Krishna. 

I cannot wait to watch the next episode.

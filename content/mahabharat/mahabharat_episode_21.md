#### Recap 
Internal politics continues as the children are pitted against each other fighting the previous generation's fights. 

#### Chivda
> Hastinapur ab uss jheel ki tarah hai, jisme Shatabdiyon ka paani thehra hua hai aur ab jisme se durgandh aane lagi hai. 

#### Synopsis
Vidur and Bhishma find out who tried to kill Bheem and lament their fate.
Bhishma tries to find comfort in the fact that he can still try and turn
Duryodhan to the path of Dharma. In other parts of India, Krishna gets his
training under rishi Sandipani and finds a true friend in Sudama. The Kuru sons
encounter Drona.

#### Discussion
Another brilliant performance by Mukesh Khanna as Bhishma in this show. At one
point you forget that this is a TV show and are moved into the world of
theater. It's as if Bhishma himself is there lamenting the loss of all that is
true and honorable in the Kuru Clan. Instead of discussing more about it, I
will let the dialogue speak for itself below. While Bhishma's ray of hope lies
in Duryodhan giving up the way of Shakuni, it seems very unlikely the way that
Duryodhan has acted the past few episodes.

Another pleasing appearance by Krishna in this episode. That kid is always
smiling and has a *knowing* look on his face. He has been aptly chosen. We also
get introduced to Sudama, played by the familiar face of Sumeet Raghavan. It
took me a while to recognize him but once you do, all you can see is Sahil
Sarabhai.

The chivda story is a close to my heart. Krishna and Sudama are sent to the
forest to gather firewood and Gurumaa (The wife of Guru) sends with them some
chivda to share and eat. Chivda is a snack made of rice. While they are
working, it rains heavily and they both climb two different trees. It rains all
night and in hunger, Sudama eats all the chivda meant for the two of them.
Although after this he regrets his actions. I think the chivda is a metaphor
for the gains or good fruits of labor that we gain in our lives, and whether or
not we share it with the god, who resides in every one of us. Even if you don't
share fruits of your labor, only god forgives your acts, like Krishna forgave
Sudama.

In the end we get introduced to a significantly important character, Guru
Drona. The one who made Arjun who he was, and the one who will be there until
the end to witness the greatest battle in Bharatvarsh.

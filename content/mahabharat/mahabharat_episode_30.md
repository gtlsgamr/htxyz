#### Surang 
> Duryodhan: Lagne laga hai ki bhagya bhi hamara paksh lene laga hai.

> Shakuni: Bhagya hamara paksh kya lega! Bhagya keval kayaro ka sahara hai.

#### Synopsis 
Shakuni wants Duryodhan to ensure that ALL Pandavs, and not only Yudhisthir
should go to Varnavat. While Duryodhan tries to figure out how to do this,
Pandavs themselves decide to go together with their mother, elating an already
happy Duryodhan. Vidur figures out Shakuni's plan and warns the Pandavs that
Shakuni is planning to burn them alive in that palace. He sends a miner to dig
a tunnel so that the Pandavs can save themselves.

#### Discussion 
The first half of the episode is a bit glum in nature. Pandavs fall into the trap themselves and it seems like Duryodhan will succeed. I think Vidur is that smartest man in this story. He is somewhat like The spider from Game of thrones, but morally superior. I really wish there were more scenes with Vidur, the actor and the lines are beautiful.

The way Vidur warns the Pandavs right in front of Shakuni and Duryodhan seemed a bit off. It felt like Shakuni-Duryodhan were too dumb to realize what he was saying. Which animal survives a forest fire? It clearly alluded to their plan but they seemed to be unaware of it. I guess bad writing? I don't know. If you are still reading this, congratulations! I feel like I am writing these for no reason at all. There are no readers for this series. But I will complete it one day, for sure.

#### Ran-Chhod

> Main naam dekhoon ya parinaam?

#### Synopsis 
Parshuram directs Shri Krishna to Mathura, which is constantly under attack by
Jarasandh who wants vengeance from Krishna for killing his friend Kans. While
Krishna and Balram manage to win a battle, Krishna suggests a permanent
solution- to relocate Mathura. The yadav clan agrees and relocate Mathura to
Dwarika, thus avoiding bloodshed. On the other hand in Hastinapur, the question
of the rightful heir is ringing in every ear. The royal court is split into two
sides, one that wants Yudhishthir as the king, and the other with Duryodhan. It
is now up to Dhritrashtra to choose who to please, his city.. or his ego.

#### Discussion 

- Just like the previous episode, another war scene takes place here, between
  Mathura and Jarasandh. One scene worth noting is a horse getting shot by an
  arrow. I hope the stuntman was safe, and the horse as well.

- In this episode we witness a rare thing. We get to see Dhritrashtra's spine!
  I think this is the first time that the blind king stood up to Shakuni. When
  Shakuni suggests that Bhishma was giving empty threats, Dhritrashtra could
  not see his childhood idol being insulted like that and promptly told Shakuni
  that Bhishma does not give empty threats. If he says something, it should be 
  the truth.

- On one hand we saw a god trying his best to avoid a war, and on the other one
  we will see the same god try to start one. _Dharma-Yuddh_ is a necessity, and
  cannot be avoided. We also see why Krishna got the name Ran-Chhod, because he
  left the _ranbhoomi_ (Battlefield) of Mathura to save his people. Balram was
  not too happy with it, but such is Balram. Whether as an elder to Krishna, or
  a younger to Shri Ram. Always ready for war.

#### Synopsis 
The Kauravs plan is put into action, and so is the Pandav's. They burn the palace one night before, burning Pulochan and others with it. 

#### Discussion 
A lot happens in this episode. The palace burns, Karna questions his allegiance
while Duryodhan celebrates his ill-gained victory. Gandhari has a nightmare,
indicative of the coming times. Her home is burning and Mahadev, the one she
worships so devotedly performs Tandav in her home. When asked for help, he does
nothing but looks at her. She sees Agni dev, but he too turns into an ever
consuming flame and burns down everything around her. No deity will help her
get out of the mess that her brother and sons have made. Dhritrashtra tries to
calm her down, but he himself knows on some level that something wrong is going
on.

Karna on the other hand is not feeling good about all this. As he cuts blocks
of wood, the axe seems to be his conscience hitting away at his never ending
love for Duryodhan. Yet, he chooses Duryodhan, no matter what. Such is the
power of kindness shown to the right person at the right time. Duryodhan tries
to falsely justify his wrongs but Karna shuts him down. 

When Shakuni tries to tell Gandhari and Dhritrashtra of what happened, the
blind king immediately blames him. He knows the lengths Shakuni will go to see
Duryodhan accomplish what he envisioned for him. While Dhritrashtra is a grey
character, his remorse for the death of Pandavs seemed genuine. His tears were
real. Bheeshma's reaction on hearing this news was as expected, but it is not
sure yet whether or not he knows of the fact that Vidur saved them.

#### Drona's revenge

> Keval paanch?

#### Synopsis 
Drona goes to the Panchal Kingdom to seek aid from his former classmate and
friend, Drupada. However, Drupada rebukes the friendship, claiming a king and a
beggar cannot be friends, humiliating Drona. Guru Drona, in his anger, asks
Karuav and Pandav princes for Guru Dakshina. He wants them to defeat king
Drupad in battle and bring him alive as his Dakshina. After a failed attempt by
Duryodhan, Pandavs bring him back alive, where Drona mocks him and lets him go
as a revenge for his insults. He crowns Ashwatthama as the king of southern
part of Panchal. Parshuram meets Shri Krishna and returns him his divine
weapon, the Sudarshan Chakra.

#### Discussion 

- This is the first time we see the classic war scenes that this show was
  famous for back in the day. It included lots of people, no cgi, just a bunch
  of dudes with fake swords fighting each other. The way Duryodhan screams
  "AAKRAMAN!" must have been enough to give goosebumps when this show first
  aired. Granted, it feels a bit dated now that we have seen newer, more modern
  cgi effects.

- In the final talk with Ashwatthama, Guru Drona explains why he did what he
  did to
  [Eklavya](https://hitarththummar.xyz/mahabharat/mahabharat_episode_23.html).
  It was not because of caste or royal blood, but simply for the fact that
  eklavya "stole" the education instead of getting it by legitimate means.
  *Although I think it could have been due to eklavya being a potential*
  *competitor to Drona's favorite Arjun.*

- We are treated with *another* depressing Dhritrashtra monologue. Same old sad
  story about how he is an unlucky sack who can never be what a king should be
  and how his son will not be able to continue his legacy. The dialogue is
  Goosebump worthy, when he curses his own luck and says that he will kill it
  with his bare hands if he ever meets it as if it were a person.

- The way Nitish Bharadwaj brings Shri Krishna to life in this show is
  inexplicable. Everytime the camera is on him it feels like we are witness to
  the god himself. The music, the expressions, the innocence of Krishna, it all
  comes natural to him. We see a parallel drawn between two friendships. One is
  of Drona and Drupad, where the wealthier one rejects the friendship in his
  ego trip. While the other (Krishna) treats Sudama as his kin. There is a
  reason Krishna-Sudama friendship is so beloved by all.
